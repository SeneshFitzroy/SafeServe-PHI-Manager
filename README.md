Safe Serve: PHI Manager
Project Overview
Safe Serve: PHI Manager is a mobile and web-based application designed to streamline the food inspection and monitoring process for Public Health Inspectors (PHIs) in Sri Lanka. This solution aims to replace inefficient manual, paper-based methods with a modern digital platform that ensures data accuracy, enhances productivity, and simplifies the management of inspections, follow-ups, and compliance tracking.

Key Features:
Geo-tagging: Automatic capture of location data and timestamps during inspections to ensure accurate and reliable records.
Offline-first Design: The app supports offline functionality, allowing PHIs to continue inspections without internet access, with automatic synchronization once connectivity is restored.
Search Algorithms: Advanced search capabilities to efficiently retrieve historical inspection records from a centralized database.
Scheduling & Notifications: A calendar-like feature to manage daily tasks, reschedule visits, and receive automated reminders for follow-ups and compliance checks.
Centralized Data: All inspection records are stored securely on the cloud (AWS), ensuring easy access and real-time updates.
Technologies Used:
Mobile App: Flutter for frontend development, Node.js for backend services.
Web App: HTML, CSS for frontend, PHP for backend.
Database: SQLite for offline data storage, MySQL/Firebase for cloud synchronization.
Cloud: AWS for backend hosting, storage, and scalability.
Geo-Location: Google Maps API for geo-tagging.
Notifications: Libraries for alerts and reminders.
Benefits:
For PHIs: Simplified workflows, reduced administrative burdens, and enhanced productivity.
For Ministry of Health (MOH): Centralized data access, real-time trend analysis, and optimized resource allocation.
For Government: Increased accountability, enhanced public health outcomes, and cost reductions through digitization.
For Public & Establishments: Faster response times to complaints, improved transparency, and trust in the inspection process.
